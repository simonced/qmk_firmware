# Notice

This layout is still a work in progress.
It is a layout I want to work as JIS layout.
This keyboard mapping is intended to be reckognize as Japanese JIS layout.
Since I don't have corresponding keycaps, I matched / hacked away key codes in a way that makes sense to me.

The JIS keycodes are defined in `quantum/keymap_extras/keymap_japanese.h`.

I updated the symbols mainly, should be usable.
