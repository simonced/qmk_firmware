# Notice

This layout is actually based on my BM40 layout.
I only need 38 keys, the remaining keys are set up if someone wants to use my keyboard, so they are not helpless.
This keyboard mapping is intended to be reckognize as Japanese JIS layout.

The JIS keycodes are defined in `quantum/keymap_extras/keymap_japanese.h`.
